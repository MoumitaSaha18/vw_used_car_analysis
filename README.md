VW used cars analysis towards data visualization with python. 
Objective:
1. Data Visualization using NumPy and Pandas
2. Finding number of unique values present in the DataFrame
3. Write functions in Python
4. Data Visualization by using Bar Plot
5. Changing the context of a plot
6. Creating subplots
7. Histogramic Analysis for VW Used Cars Based on Year, Price, Mileage and mpg
8. Probabilistic Analysis of VW used Cars for Price and Mileage
9. Distributive Analysis of VW used cars Price for fuelType 
10.Boxplot for VW cars pricce and mileage analysis based on fuelType and transmission respectively


Visualizing of a dataset:
1. Visualizing the dataset through different plots.
2. Top 5 selling cars in the dataset
3. The average selling price of the top 5 selling car models
4. The toatl sell of the top 5 selling car models
5. Data set Aggregation and exploratory data analysis based on model, transmission and fuel type of the VW cars.

Data Visualization: In this project, the dataset has been visualized through observation, using Bar Plot, Scatter Plot, Histogram Plot, Distribution Plot, ECDF Plot, Violin Plot and Box Plot.
